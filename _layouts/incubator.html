      <h2>The Data Incubator Project</h2>
      <p>
        To solve the most pressing issues facing the nation, we must leverage data as a strategic asset. The Federal Data Strategy will highlight examples of the use of data to solve problems and serve the public, with a particular focus on examples that can be replicated or scaled or that solve high-priority problems. A select number of Use Cases deemed “ripe for testing” will be included in The Data Incubator Project.
      </p>

      <h2>What is a Use Case?</h2>
      <p>
        For the purposes of the Federal Data Strategy, a “Use Case” is a data practice or method that leverages data to support an articulable federal agency mission or public interest outcome. The Federal Data Strategy is seeking examples that solve problems or demonstrate solutions that can help inform the four strategy areas: Enterprise Data Governance; Use, Access, and Augmentation; Decision-making and Accountability; and Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use.

        <h3>Economic Development</h3>
        <p>
          State and local authorities increasingly need detailed local information about their economies to make informed decisions. The US Census Bureau’s <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/">Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program</a> produces new, cost effective, public-use information combining federal, state and Census Bureau data on employers and employees under the <a href="Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership">Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership.</a>

        <h3>Public Safety</h3>
        <p>
          Emergency responders rely on up-to-date addresses for timely response. The Federal Geospatial Data Committee recognizes the need for a free, open, and up-to-date <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/nad">National Address Database</a> (NAD) to serve these critical needs as well as a broad range of government services such as mail delivery, permitting, and school siting. Based on a minimum content approach, the Department of Transportation and the US Census Bureau’s NAD pilot collected and standardized addresses from 22 state partners.
