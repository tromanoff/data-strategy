This includes: (1) providing high quality and timely information to inform evidence-based decision-making and learning; (2) facilitating external research on the effectiveness of government programs and policies which will inform future policymaking; and (3) fostering public accountability and transparency by providing accurate and timely spending information, performance metrics, and other administrative data.

        <h3>Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use</h3>
        <p>
          Facilitate the use of Federal Government data assets by external stakeholders at the forefront of making government data accessible and useful through commercial ventures, innovation, or for other public uses. This includes use by the private sector and scientific and research communities, by state and local governments for public policy purposes, for education, and in enabling civic engagement. Enabling external users to access and use government data for commercial and other public purposes spurs innovative technological solutions and fills gaps in government capacity and knowledge. Supporting the production and dissemination of comprehensive, accurate, and objective statistics on the state of the nation helps businesses and markets operate more efficiently.
