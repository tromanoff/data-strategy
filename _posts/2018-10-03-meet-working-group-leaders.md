The Federal Data Strategy will lay out a comprehensive, long-term approach to leveraging data to improve the ability of federal agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people.  Agency input and participation is critical for a truly viable and sustainable data strategy with a focus on executing steps towards the change we envision. Creating working groups consisting of experts from across government to inform and develop the strategy is one way to ensure this.

These working groups are staffed by members of the 2018 Federal Data Working Groups, selected from across the Executive Branch, for their multidisciplinary experience and expertise in federal data. They come from 42 offices across 18 departments and agencies. Such widespread participation offers the diverse perspectives needed for a truly actionable Federal Data Strategy.

Each working group is centered around one of the four strategic areas: Enterprise Data Governance; Decision Making and Accountability; Access, Use, and Augmentation; and Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use. The working groups are headed by seasoned government leaders and a working group coordinator from the Federal Data Strategy project management team – each with a proven track record of excellence.

We’re proud to introduce our Working Group Leadership Team!
